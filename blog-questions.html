    <h3 class="font-bold text-justify text-2xl">In JavaScript, you can declare variables with the var, let, and const
        keywords. But what are the differences between them? That's what I'll explain in this tutorial.</h3>
    <br>
    <img src="./Resources/var-let-const-cheatsheet.png" alt="">

    <p>If you're just starting out using JavaScript, a few things you may hear about these keywords are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>var and let create variables that can be reassigned another value.</li><br>
        <li>
            const creates "constant" variables that cannot be reassigned another value.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            developers shouldn't use var anymore. They should use let or const instead.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            if you're not going to change the value of a variable, it is good practice to use const.
        </li><br>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The first two points are likely pretty self-explanatory. But what about why we shouldn't use var, or when to use
        let
        vs const? As we go through this tutorial, hopefully this will all make sense to you.

    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">Undefined vs Null in Javascript</h1>
    <p>In JavaScript, there are two special types of values – undefined and null. It is crucial for a beginner to
        understand the differences between them (null and undefined) and when to use what. Let’s find out the details
        about undefined and null in this tutorial.</p><br>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">
        1. Data types:
    </h3>
    <p>
        The data type of undefined is undefined whereas that of null is object. We can find the datatypes of both
        undefined and null using the typeof operator. <br>

        typeof undefined; <br>

        //“undefined” <br>

        typeof null;<br>

        //“object”<br>
    </p><br>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">
        2. In arithmetic operations
    </h3>
    <p>
        When used in arithmetic operations, undefined will result in NaN (not a number), whereas null will be converted
        to 0 behind the screens.<br>

        // demonstration of arithmetic operations using undefined and null<br>
        undefined + 1;<br>

        // NaN<br>

        null + 1;<br>

        // 1<br>
        // 1<br>
        // 1<br>
    </p> <br>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">
        3. Undefined and null are falsy:
    </h3>
    <p>
        When used in conditional logic both undefined and null will return false.<br>
        !!undefined;<br>

        //false<br>

        !!null;<br>

        //false<br>
        Here the boolean double negation operator aka the bang bang operator is used to check the boolean equivalent of
        a value.
    </p><br>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">
        4. Comparing undefined and null
    </h3>
    <p>
        Let’s see what happens when you compare undefined and null using the JavaScript equality operators.<br>

        // comparing undefined and null<br>
        undefined == null;<br>

        //true<br>

        undefined === null;<br>

        //false<br>

    <!-- What do you mean by REST API? -->
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">What is a REST API?</h1>
    <p class="text-justify">An API, or application programming interface, is a set of rules that define how applications
        or devices can
        connect to and communicate with each other. A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the
        REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. For this reason, REST APIs are sometimes referred
        to RESTful APIs. <br><br>
        First defined in 2000 by computer scientist Dr. Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation, REST provides a
        relatively high level of flexibility and freedom for developers. This flexibility is just one reason why REST
        APIs have emerged as a common method for connecting components and applications in a microservices architecture.
    </p>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">REST design principles</h1>
    <p class="text-justify">At the most basic level, an API is a mechanism that enables an application or service to
        access a resource within
        another application or service. The application or service doing the accessing is called the client, and the
        application or service containing the resource is called the server.
        <br><br>
        Some APIs, such as SOAP or XML-RPC, impose a strict framework on developers. But REST APIs can be developed
        using virtually any programming language and support a variety of data formats. The only requirement is that
        they align to the following six REST design principles - also known as architectural constraints:
    </p><br>
    <ol>
        <span class="font-bold">1. Uniform interface:</span> All API requests for the same resource should look the
        same, no matter where the request comes from. The REST API should ensure that the same piece of data, such as
        the name or email address of a user, belongs to only one uniform resource identifier (URI). Resources shouldn’t
        be too large but should contain every piece of information that the client might need.
    </ol><br>
    <ol>
        <span class="font-bold">2. Client-server decoupling:</span> In REST API design, client and server applications
        must be completely independent of each other. The only information the client application should know is the URI
        of the requested resource; it can't interact with the server application in any other ways. Similarly, a server
        application shouldn't modify the client application other than passing it to the requested data via HTTP.
    </ol>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold">How REST APIs work</h1>
    <p class="text-justify">REST APIs communicate via HTTP requests to perform standard database functions like
        creating, reading, updating, and deleting records (also known as CRUD) within a resource. For example, a REST
        API would use a GET request to retrieve a record, a POST request to create one, a PUT request to update a
        record, and a DELETE request to delete one. All HTTP methods can be used in API calls. A well-designed REST API
        is similar to a website running in a web browser with built-in HTTP functionality. <br><br>

        The state of a resource at any particular instant, or timestamp, is known as the resource representation. This
        information can be delivered to a client in virtually any format including JavaScript Object Notation (JSON),
        HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is popular because it’s readable by both humans and machines—and it
        is programming language-agnostic. <br><br>

        Request headers and parameters are also important in REST API calls because they include important identifier
        information such as metadata, authorizations, uniform resource identifiers (URIs), caching, cookies and more.
        Request headers and response headers, along with conventional HTTP status codes, are used within well-designed
        REST APIs.
